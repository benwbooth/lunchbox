Game Wave Family Entertainment System,,,,,,,,,,"No recommended emulators found. The Game Wave is not listed on the Emulation General Wiki. Only a fan research project exists (github.com/gamewavefans/GameWaveFans) which has developed file unpacking tools but no playable emulator. The console uses DVD-based media with Lua scripting and has a small 13-game library of trivia/puzzle games."
