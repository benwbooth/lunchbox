LeapFrog - LeapPad,,,,,,,,,,"No recommended emulators found. The Emulation General Wiki indicates that there are currently no emulators available for any LeapPad devices (original 1999 model, LeapPad Explorer, LeapPad2, LeapPad3). MAME has preliminary Leapster support but not LeapPad. Preservation efforts are ongoing."
